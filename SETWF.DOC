SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

AT 386 or above Computer (for best performance)

DOS 3.20 or above (I tested this program under MS-DOS 6.2)
		  (Brandon has tested this program under MS-DOS 5.0)

Turtle Beach System's MAUI Soundcard with SampleStore capability
    (or compatible: TROPEZ, TROPEZ+ and RIO, but not MONTEREY - see NOTES.)


FEATURES OF SETWF
-------------------
  This utility is useful when you want to use a DOS sequencer or any other
    DOS programs for your WaveFront soundcard.
  For example:
  If you play a MIDI file but the volume is too high then you can
    see the peak levels (in a DOS-shell) and set the volume you want.
  If you want to download a WaveFront Bank, Program, DrumKit file or a
    mono or stereo WAVE file in the DOS, you can do it.
  And now SETWF support John Cafarella's WFS file format and TBS's WSS
    file too!
  You can get the WaveFront and Channel status.
  SETWF can list all of the programs, patches, and samples which are
    in the card.
  For more features see OPTIONS.


NOTE TO SETWF.CFG
-------------------

  You can modify the setting in the setwf.cfg but remember that this
  document refer to the default settings!
  SETWF.CFG contains remarks for each settings therefore they are not
  detailed in this document.
  (The config file must be in the same directory as the SETWF !!!)


USING SETWF
-------------

  SETWF [ [/|- options]  [filename.ext[,][Xx][Yy]... ]  [/|- options] ]...

  []  means optional
  |   means exclusive or
  ... means etc.

  If you don't add any parameters you'll get a short message on how to get
    help.

  If you specify a filename it means you want to download a file.

  Now the valid extensions are:
                                     .WFB      - Bank file
                                     .WFP      - Program file
                                     .WFD      - DrumKit file
				     .WAV      - WAVE file
				     .WFS      - WaveFront Set file
				     .WSS      - WaveFront Sample Set file

  - .WFB files

	 The software download all samples, patches, drumkits and programs
	 that are in the Bank.
	 This action may overwrite the internal samples.  See NOTES.
	 You need not specify any other parameters because all rooms for
	 the samples and patches are fixed in the .WFB file.

	 Sample: SETWF gm_maui.wfb

  - .WFP file

         Downloading a program and its patches and samples.

	 You can specify parameters:   [,][Px][Ay][Sz]

             ,    You can add a comma after the filename but it is not
                   necessary. (I must change the parameter interpreter,
		   because calling SETWF from a batch file, the
                   comma separates the parameter into parts.)

             x    the program number where you want to download the program

             y    the patch number where you want to download the first
                   patch. (2nd patch: y+1)

             z    the sample number where you want to download the first
                   sample. (2nd sample: z+1)

         If you do not specify one or more of these parameters,
	   SETWF will use the defaults stored in .WFP.

         If y or z (default or specified) points to a Used Sample
	   or Patch, SETWF will search for an Empty room.

	 If you want to know where SETWF loads samples and patches,
           use parameter -P and debug downloading. (The number in brackets
           is the position number where it loads to. If there is an 'R'
	   after the number, it means SETWF relocated it from the original
           position.)

         If you are not an advanced user, specify only the x parameter.

	 E.g.:     SETWF myvoice.wfp,P10    Load the myvoice PROGRAM file
					      into "Music Box" General Midi
                                              Program.

  - .WFD file

	 Same as the .WFP but the x parameter is not used.


  - .WAV file   ( SampleStore in DOS ! )

	 Downloading a Riff Wave file using default program and patch.

	 You can specify parameters [,][Px][Vy][Kz][Vy][Kz][B|I][R|N][D|E|L][a-b]

	     ,    You can add a comma after the filename but it is not
		   necessary. (I must change the parameter interpreter,
		   because calling SETWF from a batch file, the
		   comma separates the parameter into parts.)

	     Px   the program or drum number where you want to use the
		   wave sample. x<=127 value means normal program and
		   x>=128 value means DRUM number x-128.
		   (default: config.file)

	     Vy   the volume of the program

	     Kz   the MIDI Root Key

	     (B)i-directional Looping (this cause Enabling too)

	     (R)everse, (N)o reverse

	     (D)iasble Looping

	     (E)nable (L)ooping, but also work 'E'

	     (M)ono sample loading though the .WAV file type is stereo

	     a = Offset to start of loop (default: 0)

	     b = Offset to end of loop (default: SampleSize)

	 If you do not specify one or more of these parameters,
	   SETWF will use the defaults stored in SETWF.CFG.


	 Default LOOPING:

	 If the .WAV file contains Loop information, SETWF will
	 use it to determine the Loop Points and set the loop flag on.

	 If the .WAV file does not contains Loop Points, the sample will
	 not loop.

	 (You can set or reset the Loop Points with WaveSe!)


	 With this options you can overwrite this method.

			E.g.:

                             file.wav,L100-200     or file.wavL100-200
                                Enable looping sample offset 100 to 200.
                                And you see the comma is optional.

                             file.wav,100-200
                                Set Loop Points Only, Looping enabled if
                                the file contains Loop Points. So these
                                options overwrite the Loop Points settings
                                from the file.

                             file.wav,D
				Disable looping

                             file.wav,R
                                This switch tells the WaveFront synth to
                                play the sample in reverse!

                             file.wav,B
                                Enable bi-directional looping.

                             file.wav,L   or  file.wav,E
                                It cause Enabling.
                                Looping Offsets from the file or the file
                                does not contains them use the default
                                Looping Points: 0 and SampleSize.

			And you can mix these switches!

  - .WFS file		 WaveFront Set file format.
			 A simple text file contains filenames and options.
			 You can specify a text file which similar to John
			 Cafarella's WFS file but it may contains not only
			 filenames to download and MIDI files to play.
			 You can use not only downloading parameters and
			 remarks in this file. See the sample WFS file!

  - .WSS file		 SETWF now support TB's WSS file format which
			 contains information of the set of .WAV files.
			 More information in the User's Manual of your
			 card.




OPTIONS
-------

-------------------------------------------
Parameter x-y (where min<=x<=y<=max) means:

Parameter        Range

 x               [x..x]
 x-              [x..max]
 x-y             [x..y]
 -y              [min..y]
 nothing         [min..max]
-------------------------------------------

       -?               Shows help screen about options.

       -Bxxx            Set Base I/O Port Address.
			 The valid settings are:
			 330,338,320,300,290,260,230,210

       -MPU             Force SETWF to use the slow standard MPU-401 MIDI
			 interface port instead of Host Command Port.
			 It useful if you have no Host Command Port e.g.
			 you have a Rio card.

       -1 -2 -3 -4      Force SETWF to load the Base I/O Port Address and
			 the required interrupt line value from SETWF.CFG
			 and use it. It simplify using more than one card.
			 You can also specify in the config file that
			 that card is using MPU interface or not.
			 (See -B -Q -MPU options.)

       -P               Set pause mode for listing and debug mode for
			 downloading.

       -PP              Set pause mode for listing

       -PD              Set debug mode for downloading.

			When you specify -Px, the listing and/or downloading
			 will stop and wait for a keystroke between
			 two patches, samples, etc.

			You are in Pause mode if 'KEY' blinks
			 on the right side of the screen.

			If you press <ESC> the program will stop
			 or if you press <P> pause and/or debug mode will
			 be switched off.

			These modes will be ignored if you redirect the
			 standard output.

       -+		Force SETWF to update the information stored in
			 the Extended Memory. Use this option if SETWF
			 does not refresh automatically. Anyway SETWF ask
			 the card about the free sample memory and if it
			 does not equal the stored one in the Extended
			 Memory SETWF will refresh the Extended Memory.

       --		Force SETWF to free up the allocated Extended
			 Memory. If you want to use SETWF again it will
			 allocate the Extended Memory again and load the
			 data of the card. It takes some seconds.

       -XSfilename.ext  SETWF saves the used Extended Memory to the file
			 you specified. It can be loaded by the -XL
			 option.

       -XLfilename.ext  SETFW loads the saved Extended Memory file to
			 avoid the gathering information from the card.

       -Qx              SETWF try to use the card with interrupt x.
			 (It works only on cards which aren't using the
			 slow MPU port like Rio! See -MPU option.)
			 If it doesn't work properly, SETWF calls the
			 SETUPSND utility to initialize the card with
			 parameter /ix.

       -R               Like -Q option but it causes initializing
			 always. Use -Q option to specify the interrupt
			 line.

       -!		This options do nothing but useful if you want to
			 initialize the card from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
			 if it was not. (But does not allocate the Extended
			 Memory block.)

       -Vx              Set Synthesizer Volume (0..127)

       -Nx              Set Number of Voices (24..32)

       -Tx              Set Master Tuning (-8192..8191)
			 2048 per an octave, 2048/12 per half note

       -C[E|D]x-y       (E)nable or (D)isable Synth Channels [1..16]

       -D[E|D]x-y       (E)nable or (D)isable Enhanced Drum Program
			 on Channels [1..16].
			Note: After Disabling EDP on a channel you must
			 send a program change MIDI message for it to take
			 effect.

       -I[E|D]          (E)nable or (D)isable MIDI-In to Synth

       -M[E|D]          (E)nable or (D)isable Virtual MIDI Mode

       -O               Report Peak Output Levels.
			 The number at the right side of the Peak Output
			 Level indicator is the Saturation Count.
			 The number in brackets is the current volume of
			 the card.

			 Keys:
				 + or -         Set Volume
				 ESC            Stop

       -LU              Report Used/Unused/Empty Samples and
			 Unused Patches.

       -LHx-y           Show structure of Programs [0..127] or
			 show structure of Enhanced Drum Programs [128..255]

       -LRx-y           List Programs [0..127]

       -LPx-y           List Patches [0..255]

       -LSx-y           List Samples [0..511]

       -LDx-y           List Enhanced Drum Programs [0..127]

       -L               -LU, -LH, -LR, -LP, -LS and -LD options all in one

       -U               Delete All Unused Samples from Sample Memory

       -Ex-y            Delete Samples from Sample Memory
			 (Deletes only non-internal samples)

       -EEx-y		Delete Samples from Sample Memory
			 (Delete the overwritten internal samples too!)

       -S               Print WaveFront Status.

       -SC              Print MIDI Channel Status.

       -W[Px|Sx][Vy][B|I][R|N][D|E|L][a-b]

			Use this options only to modify the downloaded
			 WAVE file (or any program) header(s).

			Useful when you want to set the best loop points,
			 the best volume or others

			The syntax is the same as I wrote above at the WAVE
			 file loading. The only difference is the you can
			 specify the sample number direct with 'Sx'.
			 (With this you can modify a drum sample header.)

1. Here is a line from my autoexec.bat file:

   setwf /q2 /xlc:\maui\maui.bnk

   This line performs a card test and it isn't available at default port
   or it doesn't use interrupt 9/2 the card will be initialized by calling
   SETUPSND as SETWF.CFG file specifies it.

   How to make the maui.bnk file?

     Run SETWF /r /xsc:\maui\maui.bnk

   The port and interrupt addresses are set in the config file.
   And I'm using the maui.drv version 1.3 under Win/Win95 therefore after
   exiting Win/Win95 the soundcard doesn't requires re-initializing.

2. I don't want to include a skipping option into SETWF but there is
   the real line from my AUTOEXEC.BAT. The simple SHIFT.COM file is 15
   bytes long: B8 00 00 8E C0 26 A1 17 04 24 0F B4 4C CD 21
   It set the errorlevel if the SHIFT or CTRL or ALT key are pressed.
   (It reads the value of the [0:0417] memory address.)
   And I'm using the Symantech Corporation's NDOS command interpreter.

   @echo off
   c:\shift.com
   if errorlevel == 8 goto skip
   setwf /q2 /xlc:\maui\maui.bnk
   quit
   :skip
   echo *** Maui skipped ***

   This skips the card testing and initializing if the ALT key is pressed.

3. Every time I need to re-initialize the card I just run

     SETWF /r /xlc:\maui\maui.bnk

4. If you have more than one card then specify the settings of your cards
    (up to 4) in the SETWF.CFG and you can reference to them simply:

    SETWF /1 ...
    SETWF /2 ...



ERROR MESSAGES
--------------

No MPU device found

	   You get this message if the card did not answer at the base port.
	   If SETWF doesn't find a WaveFront card at the specified base
	    address it calls SETUPSND to initialize the card.
	   If that does not work try using another base port address.

Illegal Port address

	   See the correct base port addresses in OPTIONS under option -B.

Illegal Volume Settings

	   The volume parameter must be range 0..127

Illegal Number of voices

	   The voices parameter must be range 24..32

Illegal Synthesizer Tuning

	   The Tuning parameter must be range -8192..8191

Illegal Channel Number

	   The Channel parameter must be range 1..16

Illegal Parameter

           The range or downloading parameters are not valid.

Could not open file

           The software could not open the file you specified or
             fixed in the .WFx file. E.g. the file does not exist.
           Correct the filename or use WavePatch(TM) to correct the
             .WFx file.

File read error

	   The file you specified or fixed in the .WFx file is too short.

Not enough memory

           Not enough DOS memory.
           The software is unable to allocate a small 32K buffer.
           Free up more DOS memory!

Too old version

           The program only handles version 1.2 or above .WFx files.

Not enough WaveFront Sample Memory

	   The Free Sample Memory in the card is too small for downloading
             the .WFx or .WAV file!
           Use -E, -EE or -U to free up memory.

Invalid File Type

	   The file you specified is not a WaveFront BANK, PROGRAM, DRUMKIT,
	     WAVE, WaveFront Set or Wavefront Sample Set file. The valid
	     extensions are: WFB, WFP, WFD, WAV, WFS, WSS.

Couldn't set Internal Sample

	   This message occurs when the software is unable to modify
	     the sample header of an internal sample because it was deleted.
	   Use SETWF -R to resolve this problem!

Not enough sample ROOM

	   You want to download more samples than are free in the card.
	   Use -E, -U or -EE.

Not enough patch ROOM

	   You want to download a .WFx file which contains more patches
	     than are free in the card.
	   Use .WFB instead of .WFP!

Associated WAVE file error

	   The associated file in the .WFx is not a WAVE file.
	   Use WavePatch to correct it!

The sample size greater than 1 Megabyte

	   You want to download a .WAV file which greater than one megabyte.

MPU ERROR: Out of Sample memory

	   While downloading, the soundcard run out of free sample memory.
           Use -E -U or in some case use -EE.

Error allocating Extended Memory
	   
	   You have not enough Extended Memory (XMS) to use SETWF.
	   Free up some XMS.

The MPU device is used by another program

	   Using MIDI interface <timeout> error ocourred. Maybe another
	   program hooked the MIDI messages.

User break!

	   If you want to break the slow downloading via MPU port just
	   press the ESC key!

File error while saving used Extended Memory

	   An invalid filename or not enough disk space cause this message.

!!! If any other MPU ERROR messages occurred please send it to the author. !!!


NOTES
-----

1. This program works on MAUI or compatible soundcards but doesn't work on
   MONTEREY or compatibles because this program uses Host Commands or MPU
   commands. MONTEREY and TAHITI + RIO have no standard MPU port.

2. This program contains some routines like the Gatekeeper's routines.
   Like the Gatekeeper 'remembers' the names of the current samples and
   patches, this program uses some Extended Memory Block to store the names.
